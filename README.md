## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'm still getting a handle on images with regard to accessibility. Should I have used background images instead of img tags? What does that do for accessibility? I went about this naively, so I'm sure I have some superfluous and redundant html and css.
